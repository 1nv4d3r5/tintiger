Chilled almond & cucumber soup recipe

from Stevie Parle (telegraph.com.uk)

500g blanched and peeled almonds
1 large cucumber, washed, ends removed and roughly chopped
A handful of mint leaves, plus a few leaves to decorate
½ garlic clove, crushed to a paste with a pinch of salt
½ tsp ground cinnamon
4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little extra for drizzling
1 tsp rosewater (optional)
2 handfuls of ice

Place the almonds in a food processor and blend for at least five minutes until they are very fine, beginning to clump together and smelling of marzipan. With the food processor on low, add the rest of the ingredients. Slowly start pouring in cold water, stopping when it gets to the consistency of a thickish soup. Season to taste.

Place in the fridge for at least one hour to chill, or divide between bowls and drop in a few ice cubes to chill and loosen the soup. Drizzle with a little extra oil and scatter with mint leaves before serving. Serves 4–6.
