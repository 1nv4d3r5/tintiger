<?php
/* ebay.php - Sell item interface to user and SOAP API interpreter for ebay.com
- accepts specific input from user for listing an ebay item
- uses SOAP to interface with ebay.com to create the listing
- displays status of and fees for that listing

Looks like this will be our first foray into OO coding. All of the SOAP components use XML so building and parsing will
require a mix of OO and procedural. THis oughta be fun....
